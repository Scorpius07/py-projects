# Sum of Letters

a = 1, b = 2. Didn't know there were 26 characters in English lang? 
I know you knew, only the fact that almost never noticed that we can make sum of those!

Go ahead, dowload the code and run the "main.py" file.
Use my program (I know it's a bit.. you know) and get the sum of any word! :)

# Rock Paper Scissor
Let's play the simplest game we all have learnt in our childhood! Rock, Paper and Scissor! Well, if you don't know, you can always visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)

**Rules are pretty clear, and yet let me show.**
- Rock < Paper & Rock > Scissor
- Paper > Rock & Paper < Scissor
- Scissor > Paper & Scissor < Rock

❄ **How to use:**
- Download the code. 
- Run the file using any editor (Command prompt may work, too.)
- Input "r" if you wish to draw a Rock towards your opponent, "p" for paper and "s" for scissor.
- Quit the game by inputting "q" instead of the remaining three.

# Fibonacci-Sequence
Have you heard about [Fibonacci Numbers/Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)? I built a python program to literally get any Fibonacci sequence number! :)

## FAQs

❄ **What is way 1?**
- Let's say that you want the 5th fibonacci number instantly or the 15th one. In this case, you should use way 1.

❄ **What is way 2?**
- Let's say you want to test how good my program works or perhaps you want to go through all fibonacci numbers from the starting (0), till you get tired of it. In this case, you should use way 2.

❄ **How to use-**
- **To follow the way 1**: type "1" in the terminal after running the file.
- **To follow the way 2**: type "2" in the terminal after running the file.

If you're using *way 1*, you'd have to enter which fibonacci number you want based on it's position. Answer will be provided immediately after this!
And if you're uing *way 2*, you'd have to keep your eyes on the program for a while. Much elaborately: You'll continously be given the "next fib-number" and asked for whether you wish to end the program after each fib-number you're provided.

Enter "y" for yes, that is, you do want to *end* the program or "n" for no, that is, you wish to continu the program (recommended!).
