# Sum of Letters

a = 1, b = 2. Didn't know there were 26 characters in English lang? 
I know you knew, only the fact that almost never noticed that we can make sum of those!

Go ahead, dowload the code and run the "main.py" file.
Use my program (I know it's a bit.. you know) and get the sum of any word! :)

# Rock Paper Scissor
Let's play the simplest game we all have learnt in our childhood! Rock, Paper and Scissor!

**Rules are pretty clear, and yet let me show.**
- Rock < Paper & Rock > Scissor
- Paper > Rock & Paper < Scissor
- Scissor > Paper & Scissor < Rock

❄ **How to use:**
- Download the code. 
- Run the file using any editor (Command prompt may work, too.)
- Input "r" if you wish to draw a Rock towards your opponent, "p" for paper and "s" for scissor.
- Quit the game by inputting "q" instead of the remaining three.
