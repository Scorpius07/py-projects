# Sum of Letters

a = 1, b = 2. Didn't know there were 26 characters in English lang? 
I know you knew, only the fact that almost never noticed that we can make sum of those!

Go ahead, dowload the code and run the "main.py" file.
Use my program (I know it's a bit.. you know) and get the sum of any word! :)
